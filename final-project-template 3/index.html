        <p>SYRACUSE, N.Y. — In some parts of Syracuse, housing violations aren’t just something property owners can blow off or call a contractor to fix — they are a chronic signal of neglect and the long-term erosion of the foundations of entire neighborhoods.</p>

        <p>Over the past seven years, city code enforcement records highlight more than 120,000 violations have been issued across the city of Syracuse, mostly concentrated in ZIP codes like 13203, 13204, and 13205. These ZIP code areas include the Near Westside, Southside, and Lincoln Hill. These communities experience the highest total and per capita violation rates in the city. When normalized for population using Census ZIP Code Tabulation Area data, 13203 — the near Northside of the city — tops the list, with more than 1,780 violations per 1,000 residents — almost two violations for every person living in that area.</p>

        <p>Scott McClurg is a retired Syracuse firefighter who became a landlord and contractor, now owning his own contracting and building company, and has seen those neighborhoods from the inside.</p>

        <p>“I owned 19 different buildings in the city of Syracuse,” McClurg said. “And so we really got to watch and see what happened with the city.”</p>

        <p>After working nearly 20 years with the Syracuse City Fire Department, McClurg managed many of these properties in the same neighborhoods where his fire crews were often dispatched to. He said that what he saw only reinforced what years of emergency calls had already shown him.</p>

        <p>“It’s definitely transitioning, James. And I can’t say for better or for worse, but definitely transitioning,” he said.</p>

        <p>About 12 percent of all violations across Syracuse are categorized as severe. These include threats like infestation, carbon monoxide issues, structural unfitness, and unsafe mechanical systems.</p>

        <p>“It doesn’t surprise me, but it disgusts me,” McClurg said. “It's just, you know, it’s people. And how do you, how can you do that with a clear conscience?”</p>

        <p>McClurg said that even as a landlord, he viewed his role as one of an aid — empowering homeowners and doing good, not just a fiscal investment.</p>

        <p>“Just because, you know, people are renting doesn’t mean they’re not good people,” he said. “You know, with clear conscience, I wanted to do the right thing.”</p>

        <p>He also pointed out that the rental housing in Syracuse, especially in low-income areas, often discourages investment.</p>

        <p>“There’s definitely areas where you just, it wasn’t worth buying in the city of Syracuse,” he said. “Section 8 housing and things like that … it doesn’t make financial sense. It’s more trouble than it’s worth.”</p>

        <p>The city issues violations, then goes through its Department of Neighborhood and Business Development, giving landlords 30 to 60 days to resolve the issues before follow-up inspections.</p>

        <p>“They go through the owner, and they give you a reasonable time to make sure that it’s taken care of,” McClurg said. “They would send out the violation notice, and they’d give you 30 or 60 days.”</p>

        <p>Still, compliance is uneven. Some landlords respond promptly, while others delay or ignore notices, especially when enforcement isn’t constant. McClurg described how ethics and accountability among landlords vary widely.</p>

        <p>“That’s just the way I was raised, and that’s the way my partner was raised too. And that’s what we did, and that’s why we had good tenants.”</p>

        <p>In one instance, McClurg described giving a young mother a chance to rent, even though she came with a poor history.</p>

        <p>“There were feces in the diaper and maggots in the diaper,” he said. “It was the kind of thing where I gave her the benefit of the doubt.”</p>

        <p>The problems McClurg saw weren’t limited to just tenants or landlords. He recalled housing conditions even in areas near Syracuse University.</p>

        <p>“We realized that all over the kitchen floor was feces from animals,” he said. “We had to flush ourselves off of the fire hose outside.”</p>

        <p>ZIP codes like 13219 and 13215, which include Fairmount and Onondaga Hill, show very few violations in the dataset. These areas fall outside city jurisdiction and are more suburban, with higher rates of homeownership and newer housing stock.</p>

        <p>“The Northside has now become, you know, an area where there’s a lot of fires, a lot of crime,” McClurg said. “And the Westside is not at all a surprise.”</p>

        <p>As Syracuse begins major redevelopment, including the redesign of the I-81 viaduct, McClurg believes city leaders must look beyond new roads and buildings.</p>

        <p>“The more they can get together and have reasonable, good conversations about the problems of what can we do … it works,” he said. “It’s one thing to think you know the problems. It’s one thing to truly hear the problems and then be able to fix them.”</p>
